      <h3>Hi there! :)</h3>
      <p className="about-me-text">
        I'm the Cologne native turned Berliner who's bravely navigating the
        enigmatic waters of coding – yeah, it's a 'work in progress' kind of
        adventure. But don't let the semicolons and syntax errors fool you; my
        true talent lies in the culinary arts of risotto crafting. Give me
        Arborio rice, a generous helping of mushrooms and chorizo, a splash of
        exquisite red wine, and I’ll whip up a risotto that'll make your taste
        buds do the Samba. Coding by day and stirring risotto by night, I’m all
        about balancing those brackets and spices to perfection!
